Here's some code for a project to modify old Mobira FM transceivers
for FSK-based packet data or digital voice.
Instead of using their FM discriminator to demodulate FSK, their 455 kHz
intermediate frequency is digitized to use a DSP-based demodulator.

Sufficiently old models such as the Mobira RC25 have a varactor-modulated
crystal oscillator as the FM modulator. Fairly clean and simple FSK modulation
should be possible by feeding the baseband signal straight to the varactor.

More details on modifying the transceiver for amateur band:

We will try to implement FreeDV 2400A to provide a simple alternative
to an SDR built completely from scratch.

digimoppe/digimoppe.ino: software running on an atmega328 Arduino board.
It transmits samples from ADC to UART and controls the modulator.

grc/: Some gnuradio companion flowgraphs for spectrum analysis.

pc/: Software that runs on Linux, communicates with the Arduino
and runs the modems.
